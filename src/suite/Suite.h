 * The Suite class extends the JSON_Loader class and loads unit definition files. It stores the valid unit definitions
 * in the `units` vector. The `get_unit` method can be used to retrieve a specific unit by name. The `load_units_file`
 * method is used to load a unit definition file and add valid unit definitions to the `units` vector. The
 * `get_units_from_dir` method is used to get a list of unit definition files from a directory. The `LOG_LEVEL` and
 * `slog` member variables are used to control logging.
