 * @brief Constructor for Suite class.
 *
 * The Suite class is simply a managed container for a Unit vector.
 * Once instantiated, all methods will require either a JSON file or string to be loaded as deserialized Unit types
 * before being called or will simply throw an exception.

 * From the high level, a Suite contains the full definitions of all potential Units to execute defined in the Unit
 * definition files that it is loading.  It is meant to be used in such a way that as the application iterates through
 * the Task objects contained by the application Plan, it will iterate through the appplication's Suite, which contains
 * the definition of all available Tasks.  In this manner, defining units and executing units are split into separate
 * human processes to allow modularly developed profiles of test suites.  As inferred, Unit is expected to be one of
 * the two types that are only instantiated once per application run, though it is designed to be used more than once
 * if the implementor so desires.
